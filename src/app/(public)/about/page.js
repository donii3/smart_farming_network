              The Goodlife Smart Farming Network (SFN) is a revolutionary
              digital ecosystem designed to transform agriculture across Africa
              through technology, connectivity, and knowledge. At its core is
              AgriGo, an intelligent chatbot assistant that speaks to farmers in
              a personal, data-driven way—offering timely farm updates, smart
              insights, and expert guidance, all in a simple chat format. From
              crop tracking to climate alerts, SFN empowers farmers to make
              better decisions, grow smarter yields, and connect directly with
              trusted markets. It bridges the gap between rural fields and
              digital tools, building a future where farming is no longer a
              struggle—but a sustainable and prosperous lifestyle. SFN is not
              just an app. It’s a movement—raising a new generation of African
              farmers, equipped with truth, integrity, and innovation.

              Edward Terungwa Ordams is more than a tech visionary—he is a
              bridge between purpose and progress. A Christian leader,
              philosopher, and entrepreneur, Edward is the founder of The
              GoodLife Company, a mother venture focused on purpose & innovation
              across various sectors including farming, food, and lifestyle. As
              the creator of the Smart Farming Network, Edward believes that
              Africa’s true wealth lies in its land and people and by that
              merging digital intelligence, we can redeem the narrative of
              farming for generations to come. With deep roots in leadership,
              branding, and ministry, he is passionate about raising ethical
              businesses that glorify God while serving humanity. SFN is one of
              his many efforts to birth what he calls the ehdillionaire's
              Generation—a people made wealthy from wealthy ideas on purpose.
